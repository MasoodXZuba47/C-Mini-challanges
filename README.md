- Build problem-solving skills
- Prepare myself for larger and more complex projects
Each program here represents a small step forward — starting from basic concepts and gradually moving toward advanced topics.

##📌 What I’m Learning

- Data types and variables
- Input and output
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Data structures

##🎯 Goal

The goal of this repository is simple:
To grow from solving small challenges to confidently building bigger and more structured C projects.
This repository reflects continuous improvement and disciplined practice.
