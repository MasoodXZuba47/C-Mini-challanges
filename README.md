# C Mini Challenges 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning and improving in the C programming language.

I created this repository to:

Strengthen my fundamentals in C

Practice small coding challenges consistently

Build problem-solving skills

Prepare myself for larger and more complex projects

Each program here represents a small step forward — starting from basic concepts and gradually moving toward advanced topics.
