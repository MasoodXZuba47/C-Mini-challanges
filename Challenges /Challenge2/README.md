- if statement
- else if statement
- else statement
- Logical AND operator (&&)
- User input using scanf()
- Output using printf()


## 💻 Program Explanation

The program:

1. Declares three integer variables.
2. Takes input from the user using `scanf()`.
3. Compares the numbers using conditional statements.
4. Prints the largest number.
