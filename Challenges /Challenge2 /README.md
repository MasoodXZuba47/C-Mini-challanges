# 🔢 Challenge 2 – Largest of Three Numbers (C)

## 📌 Objective
Build a C program that takes three integers as input and determines the largest using conditional statements.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to take multiple user inputs using `scanf()`
- Why the address operator `&` is required in `scanf`
- How to structure `if`, `else if`, and `else` properly
- How logical AND (`&&`) helps compare multiple conditions
- How execution stops once a true condition is found
- How small syntax mistakes (like an extra semicolon) break program logic
- Why file naming (avoiding spaces) matters during compilation
- How to read and understand compiler error messages

---

## 🎯 Why I Practiced This

- To strengthen my understanding of decision-making in C
- To improve comparison logic between multiple variables
- To get comfortable debugging syntax and compilation errors
- To move from simple `if-else` to slightly more complex logical conditions

---

## 🚀 Outcome

After completing Challenge 2, I can:

- Write programs that take user input and apply logical conditions
- Debug common beginner mistakes confidently
- Understand how program control flow works step-by-step
